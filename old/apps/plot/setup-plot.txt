Setup instructions
-------------------
1. Goto Awesome Core -> services module and add following lines, and save (most of these lines will be present, make sure last line is added if missing.)

[services.add db service_label='DB Services' post_type='db_service' desc='database services' /]
[services.add form_control service_label='Form Control Service' post_type='form_control' desc='Form Control Service' /]
[services.add form_control2 service_label='Form Control 2 Service' post_type='form_control2' desc='Form Control 2 Service' /]
[services.add ui service_label='UI Services' post_type='ui_service' desc='UI Services' /]
[services.add notification_service service_label='Notification Services' post_type='notification_service' desc='Notification Services' /]
[services.add plot service_label='Plot Service' post_type='plot_service' desc='Plot Service' /]

2. If post type 'taxonomy_holder' does not exists create it, keep public = false. you can put this line in register module in core to do this [post_types.add.private taxonomy_holder singular_name='Taxonomy Holder' plural_name='Taxonomy Holder' /]
3. Create following taxonomies, and assign it to taxonomy holder post type, for each of these taxonomies make sure public=false, and hierarchical = true
	a. task_status
	b. story_status
	c. note_type
4. Also create taxonomy 'task_tag' and assign it to taxonomy holder post type, for this keep public = false, and hierarchical = false
5. Now import plot.xml via wordpress importer.
6. You may have to do it twice, due to limitation of WordPress.
7. run <site.url>/plot/modules/setup to setup the database tables.
7. run <site.url>/plot/modules/migration if you need to migrate old plot tasks.

In case of updating

1. Trash the plot modules and empty the trash
2. Trash the plot config and empty the trash
3. Trash the plot service and empty the trash
4. Import this xml file.

Some Issues
----------------
1. DB service might not have  meta.select_meta_key_value_pair template, please add it.
2. search service is not included in this package, also, you may have to edit summarytable, to remove % calculations
